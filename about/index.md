# About

Originally from Toronto, Canada, I did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo, with a focus on engineering physics, electronics, and controls. Over my degree I explored a few different research areas through Waterloo's internship program, and particularly enjoyed a project in which I wrote some MATLAB code to simulate current flow through semiconductor heterostructures using a self-consistent Schroedinger-Poisson approach. Staying for my Masters in Electrical Engineering, I then specialized in device physics, publishing in the area of 2D-material electronics and optoelectronics simulations. During this time I did my coursework in physics and computer science in order to understand the underlying physics of quantum transport, and techniques in computational linear algebra which allow them to be efficiently implemented in code.

Recently I moved to Switzerland to pursue my PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zürich, where I'm working on ab-initio modelling systems of memory devices for neural network hardware accelerators. I'm also starting to learn a bit about computational neuroscience and neuron modelling methods. For the long term, my research interests are in designing and simulating electronic devices that can mimic the operation of biological neurons, and developing algorithms which can harness these bio-inspired primitives to build computing systems with the same low-power, small-data requirements of the brain.

My earliest and most significant inspiration has been the book 'Gödel Escher Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter. My path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw heavily from the questions it poses about the emergent nature of intelligence, and how it can be represented in physical systems.

Since my work is primarily computational and I'm sitting for most of the day, in my free time I enjoying anything that is active or outdoors, including climbing, hiking, running, or just meeting up with friends for long chats over coffee.
