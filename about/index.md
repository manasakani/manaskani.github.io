# About

Originally from Toronto, Canada, I did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo with a focus on physics and nanoelectronics. My undergrad research projects at Waterloo shared the general theme of 'implementing physics in code'; in my third year I wrote a code which solved for current across lasers built from semiconductor heterostructures, and used stochastic global optimization methods to search for heterostructures with improved lasing potential. I continued in the area of device physics for my Masters', exploring ways to modulate (using strain, defect structure) the material properties of opto/electronic devices to tailor current flow through them. My 'computational setup' for this work was a combination of ab-initio materials modelling codes for electronic structure calculations, and a quantum transport framework based on the single-particle propagator. I developed/connected these codes and used them to understand how specific changes in the atomic structure of materials translated to variations in their transport phenomena.

Recently I moved to Switzerland to pursue my PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zürich, where I'm working on building multiscale modelling frameworks of memory cells for neural network hardware accelerator- and bio-inspired computing- applications. My work over the last year has been on developing an entirely ab-initio framework to simulate resistive switching in oxide-based valence change memory (more details are in the CV section).

The book 'Gödel Escher Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter was my earliest inspiration. My path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw heavily from the questions it poses about how the emergent nature of intelligence can be represented in physical systems.
