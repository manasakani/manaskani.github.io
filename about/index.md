I grew up in Toronto, and did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo, with a focus on physics, electronics, and controls. Staying for my Masters in Electrical Engineering, I specialized in device physics, publishing in the area of 2D-material electronics and optoelectronics.

In September of 2021 I moved to Zürich, Switzerland to pursue my PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zurich. I'm currently working on ab-initio simulations of valence-change memristors for neural network hardware accelerators, using a coupled Kinetic Monte Carlo + DFT + NEGF approach to capture the natural stochasticity of these devices.

Using this background in fundamental device physics, I'm interested in designing and simulating ultra-scaled electronic devices which can mimic the way individual neurons compute, and developing  algorithms which can harness these bio-inspired computing primitives to build computing systems which show the same low-power, low-data requirements of the brain.

My earliest and most significant inspiration has been the book 'Gödel Escher Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter, which I read over the course of three years in middle school. My chosen path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw heavily from the questions it poses about the emergent nature of intelligence, and how it can be represented in physical systems.
