# About

Originally from Toronto, Canada, I did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo, with a focus on engineering physics, electronics, and controls. Over my degree I explored a few different research areas through Waterloo's internship program, and particularly enjoyed a project in which I wrote some simple code to simulate current flow through semiconductor heterostructures.

Staying for my Masters in Electrical Engineering, I then continued in device physics, publishing some of my work in the area of 2D-material electronics and optoelectronics simulations. During this time I did coursework in physics and computer science in order to understand both the underlying physics of quantum transport, and the numerical methods which allow them to be efficiently implemented in code.

Recently I moved to Switzerland to pursue my PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zürich, where I'm now working on ab-initio modelling systems of memory devices for neural network hardware accelerators. In parallel, I'm also starting to learn a bit about computational neuroscience. My long-term research interests are in designing and simulating electronic devices that can mimic the operation of biological neurons, and developing algorithms which can run on these bio-inspired computing primitives.

The book 'Gödel Escher Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter, which I read over two years in middle school, was my earliest and most significant inspiration. My meandering path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw heavily from the questions it poses about how the emergent nature of intelligence can be represented in physical systems.
