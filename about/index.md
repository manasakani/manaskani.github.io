# About

Originally from Toronto, Canada, I did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo with a focus on physics and nanoelectronics. My undergrad research projects at Waterloo shared the general theme of 'implementing physics in code'; in my third year I wrote a code which solved for current across lasers built from semiconductor heterostructures, and used stochastic global optimization methods to search for heterostructures with improved lasing potential. I continued in the area of device physics for my Masters', exploring ways to modulate the material properties of opto/electronic devices to tailor current flow through them. My 'computational setup' for this work was a combination of ab-initio materials modelling codes for electronic structure calculations, and a quantum transport method based on the single-particle propagator. I developed/connected these codes and used them to understand how specific changes in the atomic structure of materials translated to variations in their transport phenomena.

At the end of 2021 I moved to Switzerland to start a PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zürich. Here, I'm working on multiscale modelling of memory cells for applications in neuromorphic computing. Over the past year I've been developing an atomistic framework to simulate resistive switching in oxide-based valence change memory, and I'm now extending its capabilities and attempting to model other mechanisms of resistive switching at this scale.

The book 'Gödel, Escher, Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter was my earliest inspiration. My path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw from the questions it poses about how the emergent nature of intelligence can be encoded into physical computing primitives.
