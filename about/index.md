# About

Originally from Toronto, Canada, I did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo with a focus on nanoelectronics. My undergrad research projects at Waterloo shared the general theme of 'implementing physics in code'; in my third year I wrote a code which solved for current across lasers built from semiconductor heterostructures, and used stochastic global optimization methods to search for heterostructures with improved lasing potential. I continued in the area of device physics for my Master's, exploring ways to modulate (using strain, defect structure) the material properties of opto/electronic devices to tailor current flow through them. My 'computational setup' for this work was a combination of ab-initio materials modelling codes for electronic structure calculations, and a quantum transport framework based on the single-particle propagator. 

Recently I moved to Switzerland to pursue my PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zürich, where I'm working on building multiscale modelling frameworks of memory cells for neural network hardware accelerator- and bio-inspired computing- applications.

The book 'Gödel Escher Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter was my earliest inspiration. My meandering path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw heavily from the questions it poses about how the emergent nature of intelligence can be acheived in systems of physical devices.
