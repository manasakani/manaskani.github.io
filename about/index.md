I grew up in Toronto, Canada, and did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo, with a focus on engineering physics, electronics, and controls. Staying for my Masters in Electrical Engineering, I specialized in device physics, publishing primarily in the area of 2D-material electronics and optoelectronics.

In 2021 I moved to Zürich, Switzerland to pursue my PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zurich. I'm currently working on writing ab-initio simulations of memristors for neural network hardware accelerators, using a coupled Molecular Dynamics + Density Functional Theory + Non-Equilibrium Green's Function transport approach to capture the natural stochasticity of these devices.

In general, I'm interested in pursuing research which designs and simulates electronic devices that can mimic the way biological neurons compute, and developing algorithms which can harness these bio-inspired primitives to build computing systems with the same low-power, small-data requirements of the brain.

My earliest and most significant inspiration has been the book 'Gödel Escher Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter. My chosen path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw heavily from the questions it poses about the emergent nature of intelligence, and how it can be represented in physical systems.
