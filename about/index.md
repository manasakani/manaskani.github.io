# About

Originally from Toronto, Canada, I did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo with a focus on physics and nanoelectronics. At the end of 2021 I moved to Switzerland to start a PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zürich.

My research is focused on understanding and optimizing the behavoir of semiconductor devices - such as memory cells, transistors, photodetectors, and lasers - through ab-initio and atomistic simulations. I particularly enjoy writing physics simulations 'from scratch'. This means starting from the relevant effects observed in experiments, connecting them to physics to build simulation methods, exploring numerical methods to implement them in code, and then applying principles of High Performance Computing and using available supercomputing resources to simulate experimentally-relevant system sizes/timescales. 

The book 'Gödel, Escher, Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter was my earliest inspiration. My path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw from the questions it poses about the physical properties of computing primitives that can encode emergent intelligence.
