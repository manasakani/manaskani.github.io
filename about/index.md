# About

Originally from Toronto, Canada, I did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo with a focus on physics and nanoelectronics. At the end of 2021 I moved to Switzerland to start a PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zürich.

My research is focused on understanding and optimizing the behavior of semiconductor devices - such as memory cells, transistors, photodetectors, and lasers - through ab-initio and atomistic simulations. I enjoy writing physics simulations 'from scratch'. This involves (1) starting from the relevant effects observed in experiments, (2) connecting them to physics to build simulation tools, (3) exploring optimal numerical methods to implement them in code, and (4) optimizing the performance of my custom applications to leverage accelerators (GPUs) and supercomputers in order to treat experimentally-relevant domain sizes and timescales. I have a rigorous understanding of domain-specific simulation approaches in materials science (Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics, Kinetic Monte Carlo, Finite Element) and device physics (Quantum Transport), which I combine with Machine-Learning (ML) workflows and principles of High Performance Computing (HPC).

The book 'Gödel, Escher, Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter was my earliest inspiration. My path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw from the questions it poses about the physical properties of computing primitives that can encode emergent intelligence.
