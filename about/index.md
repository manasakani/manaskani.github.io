# About

Originally from Toronto, Canada, I did my Bachelor's degree in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo with a focus on physics and nanoelectronics. At the end of 2021 I moved to Switzerland to start a PhD in the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zürich.

My research is focused on understanding and optimizing the behavior of semiconductor devices - such as memory cells, transistors, photodetectors, and lasers - through ab-initio and atomistic simulations. I enjoy writing physics simulations 'from scratch'. This means starting from the relevant effects observed in experiments, connecting them to physics to build simulation tools, and exploring optimal numerical methods to implement them in code.

The book 'Gödel, Escher, Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter was my earliest inspiration. My path of study was influenced by its emphasis on consilience, and my research interests draw from the questions it poses about the physical properties of computing primitives that can encode emergent effects.
