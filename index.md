Hi! Welcome to my website, in which I've tried to gather most of my experience and interests in a single convenient location.

I'm a first-year PhD student at the [Computational Nanoelectronics](https://nano-tcad.ee.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich, and my research interests are in the area of designing and simulating nanoelectronic devices for bio-inspired computing hardware.

This website currently just contains my [research interests](/about) and [CV](/cv), but will eventually be extended to include presentations and blog posts.
