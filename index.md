# Manasa Kaniselvan

Hi! Welcome to my website, in which I've tried to gather most of my experience and interests in a single convenient location.


I'm a first-year PhD student at the [Computational Nanoelectronics](https://nano-tcad.ee.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich, and my research interests are in the area of designing and simulating nanoelectronic devices for bio-inspired computing hardware. I was previously at the University of Waterloo in Canada, near where I grew up in Toronto.

This website currently just contains my [research interests](/about) and [CV](/cv), but will eventually be extended to include presentations and blog posts. You can also check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/manasakani), but most of my repositories there are private for now.

In my free time, I enjoy anything which is active and outdoors (climbing, hiking, running, cycling) and meeting up with friends for long chats over coffee.
