Hi! I'm a second-year PhD student at the [Computational Nanoelectronics Group](https://nano-tcad.ee.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich, and my research is in ab-initio simulations of nanoelectronic devices for bio-inspired computing hardware.

This website currently just contains my [research interests](/about) and [CV](/cv), but will eventually be extended.
