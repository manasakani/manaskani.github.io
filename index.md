Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in the [Computational Nanoelectronics Group](https://nano-tcad.ee.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich, and my research is in ab-initio simulations of nanoelectronic and nanoionic devices.

This website currently just contains my [research interests](/about) and [CV](/cv), but will eventually be extended.
