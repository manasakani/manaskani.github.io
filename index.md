# Manasa Kaniselvan

Hi! Welcome to my website, in which I've tried to gather most of my experience and interests in a single convenient location.

I'm a first-year PhD student at the Integrated Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, and my research interests are in the area of simulating and designing nanoelectronic devices for bio-inspired computing hardware. I was previously at the University of Waterloo in Canada, near where I grew up in Toronto.

In my free time, I enjoy anything which is active and outdoors (climbing, hiking, running, cycling) and meeting up with friends for long chats over coffee.
